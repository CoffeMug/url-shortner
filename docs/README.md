The application is dependant to the followings:

* python-pip
* lpthw.web
* nose

In order to run the application while you are on top level directory of the app:
    `python url_shortner/app.py 9090`

This assumes port 9090 is free in your system. Otherwise use another number.
Then start a web browser and go to `localhost:9090`
